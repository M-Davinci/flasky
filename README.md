Flasky
======

This repository contains the source code examples for the second edition of my O'Reilly book [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com).

The commits and tags in this repository were carefully created to match the sequence in which concepts are presented in the book. Please read the section titled "How to Work with the Example Code" in the book's preface for instructions.

For Readers of the First Edition of the Book
--------------------------------------------

The code examples for the first edition of the book were moved to a different repository: [https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky-first-edition](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky-first-edition).

## 《Flask Web开发》-第一部分：Flask简介
1. 熟悉了Flask整体架构，以及各功能模块的使用；
2. 由于书本中使用的包比较老旧，所以改用最新的工具包；
3. 项目工程化的相关知识，包之间的构建搭配；
